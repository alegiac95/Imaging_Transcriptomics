What is imaging transcriptomics?
================================

Imaging transcriptomics is a methodology that allows to identify the spatial autocorrelation between gene expression patterns and some property of brain structure or function as measured by neuroimaging (e.g., MRI, fMRI, PET).

An overview of the methodology can be seen in the figure below.

In brief, average values of the scan are extracted from 41 brain regions as defined by the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas. Regional values are then used to perform partial least squares (PLS) regression with gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) mapped to the DK atlas, in the left hemisphere only. 

As a result of the PLS regression we obtain the ranked genes list according to the spatial alignment with the neuroimaging marker of interest.

Allen Human Brain Atlas
-----------------------
The Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) freely available multimodal atlas of gene expression and anatomy comprising a comprehensive ‘all genes–all structures’ array-based dataset of gene expression and complementary *in situ hybridization* (ISH) gene expression studies targeting selected genes in specific brain regions. Available via the Allen Brain Atlas data portal (`www.brain-map.org <www.brain-map.org>`_), the Atlas integrates structure, function, and gene expression data to accelerate basic and clinical research of the human brain in normal and disease states [Shein2012]_. 


Desikan-Killiany Atlas
----------------------
The Desikan-Killiany atlas is a parcellation atlas of the human brain, which includes both cortical and subcortical regions.

This atlas is derived from a dataset of 40 MRI scans where 34 cortical ROIs were manually delineated for each of the individual hemispheres. More details on the ROIs of the atlas or methods to derive it refer to the original paper [Desikan2006]_

Partial least squares
---------------------
Partial least squares (PLS) is a method used to construct predictive models when the *measured variabels* (*factors*) are many and highly collinear, contrary to multiple linear regression, where the factors are few and not significantly collinear.

PLS as a method has an enphasis on predicting the responses and not necessarily in understanding the underlying relationship.

The idea of PLS is to ectract underlying (*latent*) factors accounting for as much of the variation of the factor while modelling the responses as well.

In PLS the X scores  (**X**, *factors*) and the Y scores (**Y**) are chosen so that the relationship between successive pairs of scores is as strong as possible [Tobias1996]_
